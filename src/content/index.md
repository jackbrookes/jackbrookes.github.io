# Hi

I'm Jack, a programmer & researcher at UCL. I have a PhD in the area of cognitive science, where I helped re-ignite the use of VR technologies in human behaviour research. Specifically, I built software that allowed for the creation of novel motor decision making experiments to gain insight into how humans learn from errors. Some of my interests:

* Immersive technologies (VR/AR) for non-gaming applications
* Development of interactive software, developer tools & packages in Unity3D 
* Coding with craftsmanship: producing efficient, intuitive, and maintainable software
* The study of human cognition, learning, & action
* Data processing, modelling, visualisation, and analysis
